## 🎸 LavaLink Setup

AeroX Music requires a LavaLink server to function. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use a Public LavaLink Server
You can use free public LavaLink servers (not recommended for production):
- [LavaLink Public Servers List](https://lavalink.darrennathanael.com/)

### Option 2: Host Your Own LavaLink Server
1. Download LavaLink from [GitHub](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases)
2. Create an `application.yml` configuration file
3. Run LavaLink: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
4. Update your `.env` with your LavaLink credentials

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Prefix
Edit `AeroX-Music/config.js`:
```javascript
PREFIX: '!',  // Change to your desired prefix
```

### Adjusting Playlist Limits
```javascript
MUSIC: {
    PLAYLIST_LIMIT: 3,  // Maximum number of playlists per user
}
```

### Artwork Style
Choose between `MusicCard` (custom image card) or `Banner` (media gallery):
```javascript
MUSIC: {
    ARTWORK_STYLE: 'MusicCard'  // or 'Banner'
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to commands
- Ensure the bot has proper permissions in your server
- Check that the bot token is correct
- Verify LavaLink is running and accessible

### Music doesn't play
- Confirm LavaLink server is online
- Check LavaLink credentials in `.env`
- Ensure the bot has `Connect` and `Speak` permissions in voice channels

### Spotify links don't work
- Add your Spotify Client ID and Secret to `.env`
- Get credentials from [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
